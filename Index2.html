  <p><B><h1>The Best Point Guard</h1></b></p> 
  
<p><B><h3>Chapter One: A New All Star</h3></b></p>
<p>The final game has only two seconds left. The Lakers are leading two points in TD Garden. The Celtics have called their last timeout. They get their last opportunity to take the winning shot. This is the most important game in the whole season. Before this game, the aggregate score is 3-3. Both sides know what losing this game means; that means losing the whole season. Neither of the two teams wants to lose this game. I think players are willing to shorten five years of their life to win.</p>
<p>As the leader of the Lakers. Kobe did a very good job in this game. He scored 32 points, 10 rebounds, and 7 assists tonight. He just got the 32nd point before the timeout by a jump shot. If the Lakers win the final, Kobe would be the final MVP without any doubt. However, as long as the game is not over, the Celtics still have a chance to change history. Two veterans, Paul Pierce and Keven Garnett, performed as usual. 	</p>	
<p>"Du......" The ring is ringing. Players go back to the court. The Los Angeles Lakers send Derek Fisher, Kobe Bryant, Lamar Odam, Pau Gasol, and Andrew Bynum on the court. The Boston Celtics send Rajon Rondo, Ray Allan, Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Allan Law. Obviously, the Celtics want to make a three-point shot. People might not be able to understand why Allan Law is still on the court, because he is just the second point guard on the Celtics. But something makes Celtics fans crazy tonight. Allan Law is so hot tonight. He played just 25 minutes, but he hit 7 three-point shots and got 27 points. This is his new career high. As a 20 year old second year player, he is doing great enough. </p>
<p>Everyone in the audience has already stood up. The auditorium looks like a green wave in the ocean. So much noise in TD Garden. But we could still hear Lakers coach Phil Jackson yelling, "No foul, no foul!" Are the Celtics going to make two or three points? Who is going to take the shot? The answer will be revealed.</p>
<p>The Lakers must defend tight and focus on Allan, Ray, and PP, because they all could shoot three. Rajon is going to throw the ball in. The referee whistles. Allan, Ray, and PP are running around Kevin Garnett. KG is trying to screen a shooter out. </p>
<p>5s...</p>
<p>4s...</p>
<p>3s...</p>
<p>2s...</p>
<p>Allan was screened out, but Derek is following him very tight. Allan gets the ball and he is trying to shoot. Wait! That is a fake. The defender jumps up. Allan is crossing to the left side and the time left is just 0.8 second. </p>
<p>0.7s...</p>
<p>0.6s...</p>
<p>0.5s...</p>
<p>He is wide open! The ball is shot. Time seems to stop. The ball is spinning very slowly. Flashbulbs are everywhere, cameramen want to record the history happening. Everybody is holding their breath. Nineteen thousand people are staring at the ball.</p>
<p>The ball is flying.</p>
<p>Closer and closer.</p>
<p>Almost touching the ring.</p>
<p>"Allan! Allan!"</p>

<p><B><h3>Chapter Two: Allan and William</h3></b></p>
<p>"Allan! Allan! It's time to wake up."</p>
<p>The sound breaks Allan's good dream. Allan rubs his eyes and yells "Yes! Mom!" He always gets up on the wrong side of the bed every morning. Especially when someone breaks his good dream. He sits on the bed and recalls the dream. "That was the most wonderful dream I have ever ever made! The ball was in or not?" He is asking himself.</p>
<p>Right. This dreamer is Allan Law. 15 years old, 5’8 ft. He is going to Bangor high school grade nine this year. His father is American, his mother is Chinese. He is an American born Chinese. Relatives call him "ABC". His favorite sport is basketball, position is PG. He takes his basketball everywhere. Playing in the NBA in the future is his dream. So now, you understand why he was so unhappy on this morning at his mom for waking him up.</p>
<p>It's 6:30a.m. Allan has the habit to have a short practice of his dribbling every morning before going to school. He sits on the side of the bed and dribble cross between his legs. He believes many a little makes a mickle. </p>
<p>After the short practice, Allan gets his stuff ready for school. He takes his bag and basketball to take the school bus. When he arrives at the bus station, he sees his best friend William Jefferson every morning. William is 15 years old and 5'10 ft. They have been best friends for 10 years. They went to the same primary school and middle school. William loves basketball too, his position is SF. He has the same dream as Allan, be an NBA player in the future. They play basketball every day after school. They have a tacit chemical relation.</p>
<p>"How's your morning, Allan?"</p>
<p>"Yo, I made a dream. I was on the Celtics and played against the Lakers. I saw Kobe, Kevin Garnett, and PP. It was the final game in the playoffs. We were down two points, but we had the last two seconds. I got the ball and got the opportunity to make the winning shot. The ball almost touching the ring. You know what?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"My mom woke me up!"</p>
<p>"Oh, no! So the ball was in or not?"</p>
<p>"God knows?"</p>
<p>"But that still was a good dream, wasn’t it? Did you watch the game last night?"</p>
<p>"Which one? You mean Kobe vs LeBron?"</p>
<p>"Exactly! Kobe isn’t old, he is still so good."</p>
<p>"I watched that game, even though Kobe is good, the Cavaliers still won the game. They had teamwork, but the Lakers didn't."</p>
<p>That is what they talk about every morning. Their topics are always basketball, basketball and basketball.</p>

<p><B><h3>Chapter Three: The "Big Five"</h3></b></p>
<p>Allan and William play basketball in the school gym every day after school. William is taller than Allan. Therefore, William always gets rebounds and blocks Allan's shots. However, Allan is faster than William. So, Allan always make some crossovers to pass William. When they play one on one, they have their own advantages. However, if they play in one team, they will be complementary.</p>
<p>They are playing one on one as usual. Suddenly, five guys are coming in the gym. They are the worst students in school, almost fighting every day. People in school call them "big five". They also play in the school basketball team and have won many championships for the school. That is why the school doesn’t kick them out.</p>
<p>All courts are full. However, the "big five" see Allan and William are playing in the half court. So, they plan to take their court.</p>
<p>"Hey guys. Let's play a game." Ryan says to Allan and William. Ryan is the leader of the "big five" and he also is the leader of the school basketball team. He is grade twelve, is 6'5, has a strong body, position is SF.</p>
<p>"Uh...We are leaving soon." William knew they are the "big five". He refuses the game and tries to leave, because he doesn't want to get in any trouble.</p>
<p>"Come on. Just a game, don't be afraid." Ryan said.</p>
<p>"Next time, next time." Allan said.</p>
<p>Ryan takes Allan's ball from Allan's hands and says arrogantly: "If you want your ball back, beat me first. But if you lose, get the hell out of here."</p>
<p>The ball is in Ryan's hands. Allan and William have to play this unfair game.</p>
<p>It is a two on two game. The game is to 15 points. They start the game. "Big five" get points very easily, because they are much taller and stronger than Allan and William. Although Allan and William have a good chemistry, they can't get any points. The game is over very quickly. Allan and William lose 2 to 15 at the end.</p>
<p>Ryan kicks the ball out of the court and says to Allan: "Your playing sucks! Basketball is not your sport. Pick your ball up and go home."</p>
<p>Allan is very sad. He goes to pick the ball up and goes back home with William.</p>
<p>After that day, the sentence which Ryan has told Allan always resounds in Allan's mind. Allan cares about that very much. Basketball is his love. He loves it more than everything. He practices dribbling every morning. He plays with William every day. His dream is playing in the NBA. However, someone said basketball is not his sport. You know how hurt he is.</p>

<p><B><h3>Chapter Four: Cheer up! Allan</h3></b></p>
<p>Gradually, Allan loses his passion for basketball. He doesn't play basketball any more, doesn't watch NBA games any more and doesn't talk about basketball with William any more. He even starts to hate basketball. William sees Allan lose his passion. He decides to tell Allan's father Mike what happened. William tells Mike all the details. Mike knows what he should do. </p>
<p>Mike has a good idea to treat Allan. He invites Allan to play 2K16 game with him. At the beginning, Allan says no. However, Mike uses his unique skill. He tells Allan that the loser washes dishes tonight. Allan used to be good at 2K game and he thinks his dad has never played 2K before. The bet is to his profit. How could he say no?</p>
<p>They pick their team and start the game. Allan picks his favorite team, Celtics and Mike picks LeBron's team, Cavaliers. Allan plays very well in the first quarter. He is leading by 11 points. He thinks this will be an easy game. He starts to despise his dad. In the second quarter, Allan plays unconcernedly. However, Mike gets the feeling. He uses JR Smith to make many three point balls. After the first half, Mike is down by just 2 points. Allan doesn't care, because he thinks he still can win this game. In the third quarter, Allan still plays unconcernedly. Mike uses a 13 to nothing run and is up by 8 points at the end of the third quarter. Allan is stunned. He has never thought his dad could do that. He decides to play seriously in the last quarter. In the last quarter, both sides play very tense. They are neck and neck. Finally, Allan misses the last shot. Mike wins the game by only one point. Allan is so down, because he is supposed to win this game.</p>
<p>Although Mike wins the game, he doesn't show his happy face in front of Allan. He knows Allan isn't happy right now. He talks to Allan seriously. </p>
<p>"Son. I know something happened in school. You lost your passion to basketball because of that. Can you tell me what do you think?"</p>
<p>"Well. I don't know. I worked so hard. I practiced every day. I used to love it (basketball) more than everything. But now, I don't have a reason to keep loving it. Maybe Ryan is right. Basketball is not my sport." He is like a wronged child.</p>
<p>Mike strokes Allan's head and says: "I know that hurts you. But I need to tell you, nobody can judge you. Specially, a stranger. Because he doesn't know you, he knows nothing about you. Just like the game we played. I know you thought I am a rookie. You despised me at the beginning. But what happened? I won the game. Same reason, that guy despised you. No problem, just keep playing and working hard. You can't beat him now, but one day, you will let him pay the price. I believe you. Because you are my son."</p>
<p>Allan hears his dad and feels much better. He smiles and says: "I got you, my dad." </p>
<p>Allan calls William immediately. He asks William to train with him. The real Allan is back.</p>

<p><B><h3>Chapter Five: Leave</h3></b></p>
<p>After Mike enlightened Allan, Allan gets back the passion of basketball. He is working harder than before, because he believes work more, gain more. His best friend William always practices with him. No matter dribbling, shooting or weightlifting. They are the best partners. Their skills are advanced very quickly. However, good times don't last long. William's father is allotted to the company in California. So their whole family needs to move to California. That means William is going to transfer to a new high school and have to say goodbye to Allan.</p>
<p>That day, William's family goes to the airport with Allan. Allan and William hug each other and say "brother forever". Then, William's family gets in the gate. Allan leaves the airport by himself. </p>
<p>At the beginning, Allan keeps contacting William every day after William left. But later, William gets his new friends and also the time difference between the east and the west. They start drifting apart from each other. Although Allan loses his best friend, he still plays basketball very hard every day because Allan and William promised each other to meet in the NBA. </p>

<p><B><h3>Chapter Six: College</h3></b></p>
<p>Time goes very fast. Allan graduated from Bangor high school and matriculated to a college in Boston. He practiced so hard in his last high school year, because playing in a college school team is his first step to the NBA. Fortunately, his hard work plays off. He is playing in his college school basketball team now. He is totally different than he used to be. Stronger, faster, and taller.<p>
<p>In the freshmen year, he just sits on the bench. Only plays in the trash time. In the sophomore year, some main forces graduate. Therefore, he starts to be a second point guard on the team. He can get 5.6 points and 5 assists each game. In the junior year, he is approved by his coach. He becomes a part of the starting five. He can get 12 points and 8 assists each game. Allan improves very quickly. In the senior year, he is the main force absolutely. He gets 18 points and 7 assists each game and helps his team to get in the playoffs, but they stop in the final eight. Anyhow, he has a very good performance. He has a big opportunity to be drafted in the NBA.<p>

<p><B><h3>Chapter Seven: The NBA Draft</h3></b></p>
<p>After Allan graduates from college. He gets Orlando Magic's invitation to trial. He is so happy to hear that news. He tells his parents first. His parents are so proud of him.
<p>Allan follows the directions and buys a ticket from Boston to Orlando immediately. He takes his stuff and calls a taxi to the Logan airport. After he arrives in Orlando, he sees the Magic's trainer is waiting for him. The trainer drives Allan to the gymnasium and Allan starts to try-out. The whole process only take 30 minutes. The trainer says Allan did very well. Allan is the best Asian player he has ever seen. He asks Allan to go home and wait for a response. Allan is very happy, and then he goes back to Boston.
<p>A week later, he gets another e-mail. It is from the Orlando Magic's manager. The e-mail says Allan has qualification to be drafted and he must show up for the NBA draft.
<p>In that day, Allan wears his suit and takes his parents to the NBA draft. The Orlando Magic has the 5th pick for the first round and the 15th pick for the second round. Allan knows he is not going to be picked in the first round, so he expects the second round. 
<p>"With the 15th pick the Orlando Magic selected......" </p>
<p>"......Michael Johnson, from UCLA."</p>
<p>Allan is stunned. It's not his name. Mike and Allan's mother hug him, and comfort him. Allan wants to cry, but he knows he can't.</p>
<p>After the draft, they come back to their hotel. Allan gets in his room, locks the door, and sits on the bed. He cries. Hard. Crying like a kid. He hasn't cried like a kid for a long time. The result beats him. He is still thinking that moment. That moment was cold and dark. Nothing is sadder like this.</p>
<p>Suddenly, his phone rings. He controls his emotion and picks up the phone. The call is from the Magic's manager. Allan is stunned again. He can't find a reason to explain why the Magic's manager is calling him. He slides the screen and listens the phone.</p>
<p>"Hi, it's Allan."</p>
<p>"Hey, my man. I'm the Orlando Magic's manager. Please don't so sad. We are so sorry that we didn't pick you in the draft."</p>
<p>"That is all good. I'm understand." Allan says that, but he is speaking some rough words in his mind.</p>
<p>"We are so sorry, Allan. But......" The manager silences a second.</p>
<p>"But what?" Allan says excited.</p>
<p>"But....we decides to sign you in the free agency market. Welcome to be a part of the Orlando Magic."</p>
<p>"Oh my god! Am I dreaming? Thank you very much! Hero!"</p>
<p>Allan cries again, but this time he cries for happy. He runs to his parents' room, and tells this news to his parents. His parents almost dance after they hear this good news. He thanks his dad, because his dad made him find his passion back. Allan's dream is coming true. </p>
<p>Next day, William watches the news and congratulates Allan on the phone. However, William tells Allan he can not play any more, because he broke his leg in an accident. He can walk, but he can not run and play. Allan is so sad to hear that. But William is very optimistic. He wants Allan to win an NBA championship for him.</p>

<p><B><h3>Chapter Eight: NBA Career</h3></b></p>
<p>Allan takes an airplane from Boston to Orlando again. But this time is a one way trip. He meets his teammates very soon. He is very excited to meet those NBA players. "Everything is just amazing" Allan says.</p>

He is not happy for the trade, because he plays well and he loves that city very much. But he is traded to his home, Boston. The city he is familiar with. People in this city like him very much. The Celtics were his favorite team when he was a kid. He is happy to accept this trade.</p>
<p>He flies from Orlando to Boston. He has never imagined he can be teammate with KG and PP. They have gotten many championships for the Celtics. They are the heroes in Boston.</p>
